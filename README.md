# WeatherForcasting_Project
This project implements a machine learning model to predict weather conditions (like temperature, humidity, wind speed, or rainfall) based on historical weather data. It explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using regression and/or classification techniques.

🔍 Features
Cleaned and processed real-world weather datasets

Trained ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Accurate weather prediction using historical trends

Data visualization for insights and patterns

Model evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, R² score
